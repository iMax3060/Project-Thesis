	Needless to say, every database management system needs to be able to manage data. The data structures used to manage those data in a database have a major influence on various characteristics (e.g. performance) of a database management system and therefore, the usage of specific data structures (e.g. B-tree indexes) and even some implementation details of those are very important decision in DBMS design.
	
	But for correct and performant operation, a DBMS needs to manage various kinds of meta data as well. Some of those meta data needs to be persistent (e.g. the catalog of a relational DBMS) but some can also be non-persistent. Because of the non-persistence of data managed by the buffer management of a DB, the meta data required for the buffer manager are also usually non-persistent. The data structures used to manage those meta data are---unlike the data structures used to manage the data---more an implementation than a design decision. For some kinds of those meta data, it's---due to the non-criticality of the specific meta data management---even reasonable to use data structures provided by the used programming language even though there might be more performant data structures for the purpose. But more performant implementations for most of those data structures don't need to be implemented specifically for one project, there are many different implementations available in open source and proprietary libraries.
